      "The Burrowsâ€“Wheeler transform (BWT, also called block-sorting "
      "compression) rearranges a character string into runs of similar "
      "characters. This is useful for compression, since it tends to be easy "
      "to compress a string that has runs of repeated characters by techniques "
      "such as move-to-front transform and run-length encoding. More "
      "importantly, the transformation is reversible, without needing to store "
      "any additional data except the position of the first original "
      "character. The BWT is thus a free method of improving the efficiency of "
      "text compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation. To "
      "understand why this creates more-easily-compressible data, consider "
      "transforming a long English text frequently containing the word the. "
      "Sorting the rotations of this text will group rotations starting with "
      "he  together, and the last character of that rotation (which is also "
      "the character before the he ) will usually be t, so the result of the "
      "transform would contain a number of t characters along with the perhaps "
      "less-common exceptions (such as if it contains Brahe ) mixed in. So it "
      "can be seen that the success of this transform depends upon one value "
      "having a high probability of occurring before a sequence, so that in "
      "general it needs fairly long samples (a few kilobytes at least) of "
      "appropriate data (such as text). The inverse can be understood this "
      "way. Take the final table in the BWT algorithm, and erase all but the "
      "last column. Given only this information, you can easily reconstruct "
      "the first column. The last column tells you all the characters in the "
      "text, so just sort these characters alphabetically to get the first "
      "column. Then, the first and last columns (of each row) together give "
      "you all pairs of successive characters in the document, where pairs are "
      "taken cyclically so that the last and first character form a pair. "
      "Sorting the list of pairs gives the first and second columns. "
      "Continuing in this manner, you can reconstruct the entire list. Then, "
      "the row with the end of file character at the end is the original text. "
      "Reversing the example above is done like this. A number of "
      "optimizations can make these algorithms run more efficiently without "
      "changing the output. There is no need to represent the table in either "
      "the encoder or decoder. In the encoder, each row of the table can be "
      "represented by a single pointer into the strings, and the sort "
      "performed using the indices. Some care must be taken to ensure that the "
      "sort does not exhibit bad worst-case behavior: Standard library sort "
      "functions are unlikely to be appropriate. In the decoder, there is also "
      "no need to store the table, and in fact no sort is needed at all. In "
      "time proportional to the alphabet size and string length, the decoded "
      "string may be generated one character at a time from right to left. A "
      "character in the algorithm can be a byte, or a bit, or any other "
      "convenient size. One may also make the observation that mathematically, "
      "the encoded string can be computed as a simple modification of the "
      "suffix array, and suffix arrays can be computed with linear time and "
      "memory. The BWT can be defined with regards to the suffix array SA of "
      "text T as (1-based indexing). Since any rotation of the input string "
      "will lead to the same transformed string, the BWT cannot be inverted "
      "without adding an EOF marker to the end of the input or doing something "
      "equivalent, making it possible to distinguish the input string from all "
      "its rotations. Increasing the size of the alphabet (by appending the "
      "EOF character) makes later compression steps awkward.$";
